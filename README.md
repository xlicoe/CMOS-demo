# CMOS-demo

CMOS simulator for ENR325

https://xlicoe.github.io/CMOS-demo/

**The state changes across wires, especially in the floating state, are not realistic.**

## How to use this demo:

### Step 1: select componnets by click the **Select** button, then pick and place the components on the board.

Above is the classic inverter (NOT gate) layout.

The truth table will be updated in real-time. Right now output (O1) is floating since there are no connection.

### Step 2: select **Wire**, then drag and connect all dots or wires.

Above is a fully built inverter.

### Miscellaneous:

+ For wire connection, use your left click to point, click, hold, drag and connect.

+ Right now it only works for CMOS simulation. Not for PMOS/NMOS only.
+ You can actually save and load your design locally (or clear all), at the manage tab.
+ Edit tool can copy/paste, or go back/forward with operations.
