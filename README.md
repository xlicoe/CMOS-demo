CMOS simulator for ENR325

https://xlicoe.github.io/CMOS-demo/

Individual NMOS and PMOS simulation don't work, since I need a "pull-up" and "pull-down" nodes to make them work. But typical CMOS architectures appear to be working.

The current changes across the PMOS and wires, especially in the floating state, are not realistic.
